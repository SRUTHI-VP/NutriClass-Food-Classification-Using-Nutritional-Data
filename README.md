# 🍎 NutriClass: Food Classification Using Nutritional Data

## 📌 Project Overview
In the era of increasing dietary awareness, the ability to classify food items based on nutritional attributes is invaluable.  
**NutriClass** is a machine learning project that classifies food into multiple categories using tabular data such as **calories, proteins, carbohydrates, fats, and sugar**.  

This project builds a robust classification system that can accurately label food types and provide insights into what makes each category distinct.

## 🛠️ Approach

### 1. Data Understanding & Exploration
- Load dataset and examine class distribution.  
- Visualize sample entries to understand inter-class variation.  
- Check dataset size, imbalance, and noise levels.  

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- Handle missing values (imputation/drop).  
- Detect and cap/remove outliers.  
- Remove duplicates.  
- Normalize/standardize numerical features.  

### 3. Feature Engineering
- Apply PCA or feature selection for dimensionality reduction.  
- Encode class labels (Label Encoding / One-Hot Encoding).  

### 4. Model Selection & Training
Models compared:
- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Tree  
- Random Forest  
- K-Nearest Neighbors  
- Support Vector Machine  
- XGBoost  
- Gradient Boosting Classifier  

### 5. Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy  
- Precision, Recall, F1-score  
- Confusion Matrix
